Excercises in Java about automata, Lexer, parser and then translator development based on a Context Free Grammar (the translator can parse the program and then translate it into the JVM machine-level language); all the excercises are progressive and used to make the final project, the one in Excercise5 folder, which consists on a compiler for a custom language (The CFG image).
This project was made by me and @LorenzoPallanza âœ¨,based on 2nd (2020/2021) year graduation on computer science (University of Turin, esame di Linguaggi Formali e Traduttori).
