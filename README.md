# LFT

Excercises in Java about automata, Lexer, parser and then translator development based on a Context Free Grammar; all the excercises are progressive and used to make the final project, a compiler for a custom language (The CFG image) that generate as output the respective machine program.

> This project was made by me and @LorenzoPallanza âœ¨,based on 2nd (2020/2021) year graduation on computer science (University of Turin, esame di Linguaggi Formali e Traduttori).
